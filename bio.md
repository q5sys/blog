### My History

I was first introduced to Open Source Software by a friend who hooked me up with a machine in 94 with Slackware installed on it.  From that point on I was hooked. I bounced around between the Slackware and OpenSuSe communitues before finally finding a home within the Puppy Linux community. I became involved in the Puppy Linux Project in 2008 and have been a member of that community ever since.  I have worked in IT most of my adult life, aside from a short stint in the USAF.  In 2011, I co-founded Obsidian Security Services, a small security consulting firm providing boutique services to business clients.  In 2013, I joined the ranks of Jupiter Broadcasting as a producer for the largest and continually running Linux podcast, 'Linux Action Show' and its spin off show 'Linux Unplugged' and become the producer of BSD Now in 2015.  Most recently, I worked for iXsystems, the company behind FreeNAS - 'The World's #1 Storage OS', from 2016 up through 2018.

Having been a passionate Open Source Software community member since the mid 90s and a developer for many years, I enjoy focusing on community engagement and community support. I am highly interested in community engagement through offering community outreach, support and education as well as bug testing and feature development.
