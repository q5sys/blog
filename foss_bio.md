### Open Source Bio

I was first introduced to Open Source Software by a friend in 1994 who gifted a machine with Slackware installed on it; from that point on I was hooked.  Aside from a short stint in the USAF and later as a gov contractor, I have worked most of my adult life in IT.  Over the years I bounced between the Slackware and SuSe communitues before finally finding a comfortable home within the Puppy Linux community in 2008 and eventually becoming a developer.  In 2011, I co-founded Obsidian Security Services, a small security consulting firm providing boutique services to business clients.  In 2013, I joined the ranks of Jupiter Broadcasting as a producer for the largest and continually running Linux podcast, 'Linux Action Show' and its spin off show 'Linux Unplugged'.  Later I became the producer of BSD Now in 2015 and the AskNoahShow in 2018.  I now produce two additional podcasts, 'Open Source Voices' and 'The Opinion Dominion', which are also both Open Source focused shows.  I'm a member of the Fedora Community and wear several hats. I volunteer on the Fedora Program Management Team, as well as the Fedora Security Team.  I'm also a maintainer for Fedora Jam and the Fedora Security Lab releases.  I'm currently the lead developer and maintainer of the Lumina Desktop, and spend a great deal of time in several Linux and BSD Communities. 

Having been a passionate Open Source Software community member since the mid 90s and a developer for many years, I enjoy focusing on community engagement and community support. I am highly interested in community engagement in the ways of support, education, and bug testing as well as developer outreach and advocacy.
